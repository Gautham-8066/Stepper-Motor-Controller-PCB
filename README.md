# Stepper-Motor-Controller-PCB
This board allows users to drive a stepper motor using a microcontroller, incorporating limit switch detection for homing and end-stop functionality. It is ideal for CNC machines, 3D printers, robotics, and automation projects.

Don't mind the limit switch placement on the PCB, I know it can't be used if its placed there, but I don't know another way to show it in 3D view instead of placing on the PCB.
I think you may Understand :)
